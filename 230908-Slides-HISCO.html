# Introduction
.pull-left[
### Motivation
- Manual labelling of data is tedious, expensive and error-prone  
- We collectively poor thousands of hours into similar work
- 4 mil. `\(\rightarrow\)` 96k `\(\rightarrow\)` 605 days of work 


### This presentation
- **Automatic tool to make HISCO labels** 
- Early work in progress 
- 98 percent precision
- How it is done

# HISCO codes
- Derived from ISCO (International Standard Classification of Occupations) 
- Invented for the sake of international comparability  
- Introduced by Leuwen, Maas, Miles (2002) based on ISCO68  
- Hiearchical structure well suited for analysis
- Common application: Convert to ranking (HISCAM, HISCLASS, etc. )
- Usually labelled with 'smart' manual methods

## The naive solution
- List all unique occupational descriptions and label them e.g. "farm servant: 62120"
- Label via lookup table  

## The challenge
- 17865 different occupational descriptions fit with "farm servant" in DK censuses ("in service", "servant girl", "servant boy", "servant woman", "servant karl")
- HISCO has ~2000 occupational classes, each with similar complexity in writing 
- Spelling mistakes, **negations**, and different spelling conventions

.pull-right[
## The solution
![arhc_small](Figures/Architecture_small.png)
- Use machine learning! 
- Multi-label multiple classification 
- Trivial machine learning problem 
- Apply tricks from the machine learning literature to improve performance on unseen examples
]

---

.pull-left[
## The tricks

- Unseen test and validation data 
- LSTM reccurent: Reads with memory "lives of fishing and farm work" (Hochreiter, Schmidhuber, 1997)
- Overparameterized neural network: More parameters than data (Allen-Zhu, Li, Liang, 2018) 
- Regularization via dropout: Some neurons are randomly disabled in training (Srivastava et al 2014) 
- Embedding: Represent language in high-dimensional space  (Mandelbaum, 2016)
- Data augmentation (Moris et al, 2020): 
  + "farmer": {"farmtr", "fermer", "yellow farmer"}

# The architecture
![Arch2](Figures/Architecture.png)

### Training 
- Model starts at random state
- Continuously tweaked towards more correct predictions

### Ongoing work
- Replacing the brains by a transformer model (BERT) *akin to a chatGPT-frankenstein*

---
# Training
![Training](Figures/Training process.png)

### Stopping condition 
- When validation loss has not improved for 10 epochs training stops

# Performance (6/6) 
**Some preliminary results** 
- Even better performance for UK data 
- 90% accuracy on Copenhagen burial records (100 random samples)
- ~90% accuracy in Norwegian census data
- 80% accuracy on Faroe Island data 


**Conversion to status scores as validation**
